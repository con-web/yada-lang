### Yet Another Dumb Amateur Language

This is just a toy programming language for me to learn something about pl design and compiler theory/concepts.

Roadmap: 

1) choose token set 
2) basic lexer
3) reason about language semantics 
4) parser -> ast
5) reason about language semantics even more
6) refine token set / syntax
7) refine parser / ast
8) rinse and repeat from 3
9) if i make it until here: try to translate to llvm ir (or maybe mlir?)
10) build the actual fun stuff: interpreter, compiler, language-server, yada yada yada...
